NOTE: Splunk is heavy. If your Kali VM has less than 4GB of RAM, it may crash or run very slowly

1. Download the Installer

Go to the Splunk Enterprise Download Page
Choose Linux and then the .deb package
Download via Command Line (wget)

# Example wget command (yours will have a unique token)
wget -O splunk.deb "https://download.splunk.com/products/splunk/releases/9.x.x/linux/splunk-xxx-amd64.deb"

2. Install the Package

sudo dpkg -i splunk.deb

Splunk will be installed in /opt/splunk by default.

3. Initialize and Start Splunk

You must run the start command to accept the license and create your admin credentials.

cd /opt/splunk/bin
sudo ./splunk start --accept-license

Username: Create one (e.g., admin).
Password: Set a strong password (it will not show as you type).

4. Enable Boot-Start (Optional)

If you want Splunk to start automatically every time you turn on your Kali machine then run:
sudo ./splunk enable boot-start

5. Access the Web Interface

Once the terminal says "The Splunk web interface is at...", open Firefox in Kali and go to:
http://localhost:8000 (or http://127.0.0.1:8000)
