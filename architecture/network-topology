The SOC environment uses a dual-adapter network setup in VirtualBox to safely simulate attacks while maintaining full system functionality.

Adapter 1 — NAT (External Internet Access)
 Used for secure outbound connectivity only.

Allows downloading OS updates, Docker images, Splunk apps, Sysmon, and Universal Forwarder packages
Provides internet access to both VMs
No inbound connections allowed, ensuring the host machine remains protected

Adapter 2 — Host-Only Network (Internal Attack & Monitoring Network)
 Dedicated isolated network for SOC and attack simulation tasks.

Enables direct communication between Kali (Attacker) and Windows Server (Victim)
Splunk Universal Forwarder sends logs → Splunk Enterprise (Kali VM)
All brute-force, lateral movement, and exploitation traffic remains fully contained within the isolated virtual network
